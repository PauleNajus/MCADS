Key Observations
Prediction Confidence:
DenseNet produces higher confidence predictions overall, with 8 pathologies having probabilities > 0.50
ResNet is more conservative, with only 2 pathologies at 0.50 and one at 0.45
Largest Differences:
Fibrosis: DenseNet (0.5402) vs. ResNet (0.0171) - Difference of 0.5231
Emphysema: DenseNet (0.5034) vs. ResNet (0.0041) - Difference of 0.4992
Nodule: DenseNet (0.5092) vs. ResNet (0.0290) - Difference of 0.4802
Model Agreement:
Both models rank Cardiomegaly and Enlarged Cardiomediastinum in their top predictions
Lung Lesion is ranked #1 by ResNet but only #15 by DenseNet
Performance Comparison:
DenseNet inference time: ~0.27 seconds
ResNet inference time: ~3.52 seconds
These differences in predictions highlight how model architecture and training resolution can significantly impact the detection of pathologies in chest X-rays. The DenseNet model appears to be more sensitive to a wider range of conditions, while ResNet focuses more specifically on a few key pathologies with lower confidence scores overall.
