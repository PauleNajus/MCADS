# User Separation Implementation Guide

## Overview
This update implements user-specific history records, ensuring each user can only see and manage their own X-ray images and prediction history.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Models
- **XRayImage**: Added `user` field to track who uploaded each image
- **PredictionHistory**: Added `user` field to track ownership of history records

### 2. Views Updated
All views now require authentication and filter data by current user:
- `home` - Assigns current user to new X-ray uploads
- `xray_results` - Only shows user's own X-ray results  
- `prediction_history` - Only shows user's own history records
- `delete_prediction_history` - Only allows deleting own records
- `delete_all_prediction_history` - Only deletes user's own records
- `edit_prediction_history` - Only allows editing own records
- `generate_interpretability` - Only works with user's own images
- `view_interpretability` - Only shows user's own interpretability results
- `check_progress` - Only checks progress of user's own images

### 3. Admin Interface
Updated admin interface to show user relationships and filter by user.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
The database migration has been created and applied:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Assign Existing Records to Users
Run the manual migration script to assign existing records to the admin user:
```bash
python migrate_data_manually.py
```

Or use the management command:
```bash
python manage.py migrate_existing_data
```

### Step 3: Verify the Migration
Run the test script to verify user separation:
```bash
python test_user_separation.py
```

## User Experience

### Before
- All users could see all X-ray images and history records
- Global history showing everyone's data

### After  
- Each user sees only their own X-ray images and history
- Prediction history is filtered by current user
- Users cannot access other users' data

## Security Improvements

1. **Authentication Required**: All views now require login with `@login_required`
2. **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
3. **URL Protection**: Direct URL access to other users' records is blocked
4. **Admin Visibility**: Admin interface shows user ownership clearly

## Testing

### Test User Accounts
The system includes these test users:
- `admin` (superuser)
- `paubun` (regular user)  
- `justri` (regular user)

### Test Scenarios
1. Login as different users and upload X-rays
2. Verify each user only sees their own history
3. Try to access other users' X-ray results via URL
4. Verify history filtering works correctly

## Technical Notes

### Backwards Compatibility
- Existing records are migrated to admin user ownership
- Nullable user fields during migration prevent data loss
- Graceful handling of records without user assignment

### Performance
- Database queries now include user filtering
- Indexed user foreign keys for optimal performance
- No impact on processing speed

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. Check admin user exists: `python manage.py create_users`
2. Run manual migration: `python migrate_data_manually.py`
3. Verify with test script: `python test_user_separation.py`

### If Users Can't See Their Data
1. Check user assignment: Verify records have correct user in admin
2. Check login status: Ensure user is properly authenticated
3. Check permissions: Verify user has necessary access rights

## Files Changed
- `xrayapp/models.py` - Added user fields
- `xrayapp/views.py` - Added user filtering and authentication
- `xrayapp/admin.py` - Updated admin interface
- `xrayapp/migrations/` - Database migration files
- Management commands and test scripts

## Next Steps
1. Test with multiple users uploading different X-rays
2. Verify history records remain separate between users
3. Consider adding user management features if needed
4. Monitor system performance with user filtering
