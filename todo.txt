For production deployment, consider:
1. Using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better performance and concurrent access
2. Setting up proper Redis cache instead of local memory cache
3. Configuring Nginx as reverse proxy for static file serving
4. SSL/TLS certificate installation and HTTPS enforcement
5. Database connection pooling (if switching to PostgreSQL)
6. Environment variable configuration (.env file)
7. Docker containerization for easier deployment
8. Backup strategy for database and media files
9. Monitoring and logging setup
10. CDN for static file delivery
